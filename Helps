The files are included several materials and the material properties are included in the codes. The material parameters can be directly import by the code.
The material properties can be found in "material properties.xlsx"

The file names of constant loading data are list as following:

High cycle fatigue and low cycle fatigue
loading_data_304.mat
loading_data_6061.mat
loading_data_7075.mat
loading_data_A533b.mat
loading_data_S45c.mat
loading_data_S460N.mat
loading_data_SAE1045.mat

Life prediction for random loading under T7075
"Random_7075.m"

Other:

"Energy_test.m"
"Fatigue_Model_D.m"

Life prediction result can be plotted by 
"plot_7075.m"

Procedure
Constand loading case prediction
For the first step, the material property file needs to be input at line #3 in constant loading prediction file (e.g. constant_304.m)
The second step, input loading file for certain material at line #22
Then, run the code can directly acquire each fatigue life prediction.

Random loading case prediction
The material properties and loading types are included in the file:"Random_7075.m"
The fatigue life prediction can be directly calculated by running the code. 
The different spectrums can be found in the line #19 to line #39
