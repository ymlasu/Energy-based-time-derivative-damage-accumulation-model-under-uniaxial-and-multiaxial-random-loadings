# Energy-based-time-derivative-damage-accumulation-model-under-uniaxial-and-multiaxial-random-loadings

This model can directly predict fatigue life both uniaxial and multiaxial loading under constant and random loadings no matter high cycle faitgue or low cycle fatigue regimes. The code is suitable for different materials. The code includes seven materials and several loading path under HCF and LCF.

The paper collects different methods and lists several methods in the table. The following achievements are proposed by our lab.

An energy-based model to assess multiaxial fatigue damage under tension-torsion and tension-tension loadings:

Multiaxial high-cycle fatigue life prediction under random spectrum loadings:

Strain-based multiaxial fatigue damage modelling:

The code is proposed under "Energy-based time-derivative damage accumulation model under uniaxial and multiaxial random loadings". All the detail in the code can be found in this paper.
